# `pl::Instance<API>.setRenderingCallback(...)`

## Definitions

```cpp
inline void setRenderingCallback(pl::impl::Instance::RenderingCallback callback) noexcept;
```

Set the rendering callback.

## Parameters

 - `callback` : a function that will be call just before presenting rendering to the screen

## How it works

If you need to draw things customly, you can use this function. It's called synchronously, so thread safety shouldn't be a concern. Note that it is recommended to write your own block instead of using a custom rendering callback. This is because its drawing will always be on top of everything else. Note that you can set up custom overlay in your [themes](docs/themes) if you need to draw on top.
