# `pl::Instance<API>.getWindow(...)`

## Definitions

```cpp
inline std::any getWindow() const noexcept;
```

Return a handler to the window.

### Returns

 - a handler to the window, typically `SDL_Window*`

## How it works

The window is created by the implementation and depend on the used graphics api (like SDL2_gpu, which will not be implemented). Most of the time, it will just be `SDL_Window*`
