# Global object

## How it works

Global object is a term used to refere a variable that can be use by every other classes. Because instancing variables outside of a function's scope is not recommended (it can lead to wrong order creation, memory leaks, dangling pointer and lots of other bad things), PresLib instantiate global variables in [`pl::Instance<API>`](/docs/instance). You can normally retrieve them with a getter. So each classes that need global variables **must** take a reference to the instance (or a pointer to the implementation) as an argument of their constructor.
