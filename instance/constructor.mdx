# `pl::Instance<API>.Instance(...)`

## Definitions

```cpp
Instance();
```

Initializes all dependencies and constructs the instance.


## How it works

The constructor of [`pl::Instance<API>`](docs/instance) chooses at compile time which implementation must be heap allocated. At runtime, it allocates the implementation which will set up its dependencies like [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/). It creates an environnement suitable to create the rest of the presentation's elements.

## Example

```cpp
// ...

int main(int, char *[])
{
	// ...

	pl::Instance<pl::GraphicsApi::SDL2_renderer> instance {};

	// ...
}
```
