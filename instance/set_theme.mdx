# `pl::Instance<API>.setTheme(...)`

## Definitions

```cpp
inline void setTheme(const pl::Theme &theme);
```

Change the current theme.

### Paramaters

 - `theme` : a constant reference to the theme you want to use

## How it works

You shouldn't be calling this function outside the constructor of a [themes](/docs/themes). Themes should call it for you, so you just have to stack allocate the theme you want to use.
